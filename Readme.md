# Introduction
This project contains a raw implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
* C# - The code only has the program.cs file with a single function.
* JavaScript - The code only has a single gameoflife.html file with a function called runConway().
No forethought has gone into the design or structure of the code.

# Your Mission
Refactor this code to the n-th degree, till you're happy or until time runs out (2020-10-23 @ 14:00).

## Instructions
1. clone the master branch.
2. refactor
3. Let us know when you're done
 
 ### The deadline for this task is 2020-10-09 18:00

# Tips
1. It's easy to test when using a simple deterministic pattern.
2. Martin Fowler wrote a book about refactoring.
3. It can help if only one person codes at any time see: Pair-Programming.

# Enjoy. Good luck. May the best squad win.!
