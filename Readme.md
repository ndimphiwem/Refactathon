# Introduction
This project contains a raw implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).
The code only has the program.cs file with a single function.
No forethought has gone into the design or structure of the code.

# Your Mission
If you choose to accept, refactor this code to the n-th degree, till you're happy or until time runs out.

## Instructions
1. clone the master branch.
2. create a new branch for your squad (you won't be able to edit the master branch).
3. refactor
4. Let us know when you're done
5. The repository will be locked after the deadline is reached, so check in regularly
 
 ###The deadline for this task is 2020-10-09 18:00

# Tips
1. It's easy to test when using a simple deterministic pattern.
2. Martin Fowler wrote a book about refactoring.
3. It can help if only one person codes at any time see: Pair-Programming.

#Enjoy. Good luck. May the best squad win.!
